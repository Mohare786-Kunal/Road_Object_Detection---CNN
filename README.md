Road Object Detection System

Overview:
The Road Object Detection System is a Python script designed for real-time identification of objects commonly found on roads, such as cars, pedestrians, traffic lights, and more. The system utilizes a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for accurate object detection and classification.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- numpy

Usage:
1. Ensure the required libraries are installed.
2. Prepare a dataset of road object images categorized into classes (e.g., cars, pedestrians).
3. Train the CNN model using the provided training data using the train_images and train_labels arrays.
4. Specify the path to the pre-trained model file ('road_object_detection_model.h5') in the code.
5. Run the script.
6. The script will initialize the video capture and display real-time video frames.
7. Objects detected in the video frames will be labeled and displayed on the screen.

Example:
Given a video feed from a camera, the script will continuously detect and classify objects in real-time, displaying labels such as "Car", "Pedestrian", "Traffic Light", etc., overlaid on the video frames.
