# Road Object Detection Model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Overview
This Python script implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying objects on the road, designed specifically for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in self-driving cars. The model uses image data to classify various objects commonly found on roads, such as cars, pedestrians, traffic lights, and more.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib (optional for visualization)

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset:
- Organize your image data into folders named according to the object classes (e.g., "car", "pedestrian", "traffic_light").
- Ensure that each folder contains images corresponding to the respective class.
2. Modify the script:
- Adjust the image size, number of output classes, and model architecture in the Python script according to your dataset and requirements.
3. Train the model:


## Dataset
You can use your own dataset or explore publicly available datasets such as the COCO dataset or the Cityscapes dataset for training and evaluation.
